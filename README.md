# Actuator-Placement-beyond-SC-and-towards-Robustness

This project is for the paper "Actuator Placement for Structural Controllability beyond Strong Connectivity and towards Robustness", co-authored by Baiwei Guo, Orcun Karaca, Sepide Azhdari, Maryam Kamgarpour, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate. 

To run the codes, one needs to add the network analysis tool box, which can be downloaded at https://aeolianine.github.io/octave-networks-toolbox/

The graph shown in Fig. 3 in the paper is encoded in "adj_not_sc_big.mat". The m-file "main.m" is the main code to realize initial set selection, forward greedy algorithm and long-horizon forward greedy algorithm. The selected actuators and the corresponding costs are recorded.
